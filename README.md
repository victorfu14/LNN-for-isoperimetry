# Skew Orthogonal Convolutions

- **Skew Orthogonal Convolution (SOC)** is a convolution layer that has an orthogonal Jacobian and achieves state-of-the-art standard and provably robust accuracy compared to other orthogonal convolutions.
- **Last Layer normalization (LLN)** leads to improved performance when the number of classes is large.
- **Certificate Regularization (CR)** leads to significantly improved robustness of certificates.
- **Householder Activations (HH)** improve the performance of deeper networks.

## TODO

- [ ] ðŸŽ¨ Draw a line plot
- [x] ðŸ§ª Implement Validation set partition
- [x] ðŸ§ª Use Square Root loss
- [ ] ðŸ§ª Use Gaussian data as a sanity check.
- [ ] Random $f$
- [ ] Different Epoch's $f$
- [ ] Use mean
- [ ] Use linear programming to check

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or 3.8
- Pytorch 1.8
- requests. Can be installed using ```pip install requests```
- einops. Can be installed using ```pip install einops```
- NVIDIA Apex. Can be installed using ```conda install -c conda-forge nvidia-apex```
- A recent NVIDIA GPU

> On GreatLakes, you need to manually download the datasets... `requests` doesn't really work.

## How to train 1-Lipschitz Convnets?

```python train_robust.py --conv-layer CONV --activation ACT --block-size BLOCKS --dataset DATASET --gamma GAMMA```

- CONV: bcop, cayley, soc
- ACT: maxmin, hh1, hh2 (hh1, hh2 are householder activations of order 1, 2; both illustrated below).
- BLOCKS: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- GAMMA: certificate regularization coefficient
- Use ```--lln``` to enable last layer normalization
- DATASET: cifar10/cifar100.

## Note

1. Given $X, X^\prime$, the loss is defined as $L(X, X^\prime)\coloneqq - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (f(x_i) - f(x^\prime_i))$
2. When reporting the loss when testing samples $X^{\prime \prime}, X^{\prime\prime\prime}$, we don't care about the sign, hence we report $\left\vert L(X^{\prime\prime}, X^{\prime\prime\prime}) \right\vert$.
3. Change the number of classes to $1$ since we only want to consider $\mathcal{F}$ such that $f\colon R^d \to \mathbb{R}$.
4. Don't need data augmentation.
5. The data is split into 20000 training + 20000 valid (every time do validation will use the whole set) and variable size testing set.
6. When using square loss, make `lr-max=0.001` instead of `0.01`
7. In `eval.log`, Training and Validation are all evaluated on n=10000. The fluctuation is crazy though...
